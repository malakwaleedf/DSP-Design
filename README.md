Spartan 6 - DSP48A1 
Designed the DSP48A1 slice of the spartan 6 FPGAs to perform multiply-accumulate operations for efficient DSP tasks in Verilog. 
Verified design functionality using QuestaSim for testbench simulation and waveform analysis. 
Synthesized the design on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA using Vivado, delivering full timing and resource
